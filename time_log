  2~3 hours at night. Algorithm: O, theta, omega, half-divided search and 3 sum. Machine learning course: review basics of regression, almost waste of time as no new information.

  Morning, algorithm union-find section: eager, lazy and weighted. Like the Princeton coursera. First time find an easy interpretation for the Monte-Carlo method. First time have an idea how extra features from a picture.
  Afternoon and night, set up enviroment on jupyter notebook for python and turicreate. Like the U.Washington coursera. Focus on application with nice open source tools.
